# Level 5

This week we learn about a crucial new type of data - Lists.
Lists are the first compound "data type" you've learnt about - one that can hold many pieces of data together.

The exercises this week focus on using lists and using Strings, as strings can often be used in similar ways to loops - indexing inside them and iterating through them.

The last couple of exercises might feel like quite a challenge.
Give yourself time and patience, stay curious, and ask for help if you need it!

Good luck!
